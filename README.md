# MWS-Restaurant Project

This is my project for Udacity's Mobile Web Specialist nanodegree.
There is a history of my project submissions in the Releases tab.

It is connecting to a backend API that was provided by Udacity which I have forked [here](https://github.com/jethridge13/mws-restaurant-stage-3).
